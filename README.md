“SKYBOT USING ROBOTIC PROCESS AUTOMATION”. 
The development of a Skybot using robotic process automation that shows available flights details 
using RPA (Robotic Process Automation) in UiPath is a feasible and practical solution that can 
streamline the process of finding the flights information. 

The robot can use various RPA techniques such as web scraping, data extraction, and data 
manipulation to collect and present flight information to the user. 

For example, the robot can search for flights on airline websites simultaneously, extract flight 
information such as flight numbers, departure and arrival times, airline name, duration and prices, 
and present this information to the user in table format. The robot then sends the information to the 
user's email using the Send SMTP Mail Message activity
